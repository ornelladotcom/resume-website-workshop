# Adding style using CSS

As we explored in the beginning of the workshop, [HTML is used to structure the content](./2-add-content.md) of a page. CSS, or Cascading Stylesheets, is used to provide style. CSS is used to set colors and fonts, where on a page information should be displayed, and other decorative items. By keeping HTML and CSS focused on these concerns (sometimes called separation of concerns), you create pages which are easier to modify and maintain, and become more accessible to all users.

## Introducing selectors

CSS uses **selectors** to indicate what to modify. These selectors can be the name of a tag such as `h1`, an attribute such as `class` or `id` - useful for modifying a group of elements or a specific one, respectively - or get really fancy and look at the entire structure of a page to determine what to modify. We're first going to focus on using tag names as selectors.

When using a tag name for a selector, you use just the name of the tag. Keep in mind, when you indicate the name of a tag, the style applies to **all** tags.

> **Note:** The word "cascading" for Cascading Stylesheets applies when multiple styles are used for the same element.

## Adding style to a page

Let's start by creating a CSS file to hold our code, so we can add style to the page. Then, we'll set a couple of properties for the `body` tag to change the font and size.

1. Hover over the name of your repository, **resume**, in the Explorer pane on the left-hand side of your screen, then select the **File with +** icon. Name the file **style.css**.
1. Inside **style.css**, add the following CSS to choose the font and size

    ```css
    body {
        font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
        font-size: 12px;
        max-width: 960px;
        margin: auto;
    }
    ```

Notice `font-family`, which is used to select the font. There are five fonts listed. Because users may not have a particular font installed, CSS offers the ability to fallback to the next font. In this case you're telling the browser to try Segoe UI first, then Tahoma if that's not installed, and so on. 

There are also a few more rules that apply to everything in the `body` tag, which is the whole page:

* `font-size` - sets the size of the font to 12 pixels
* `max-width` - sets a maximum width for your resume so that it doesn't look silly on huge screens. 960 pixels is a common width for many websites.
* `margin` - sets the margin to auto. When combined with the `max-width` property, this centers the content on the screen horizontally.

## Sizing

CSS offers different ways to indicate sizes. In the example above, you used `12px`. `px` stands for pixels, and is an absolute sizing - it will always be 12 pixels regardless of the screen used. The problem with using absolute sizing is modifications to the size require updates to multiple styles. By using relative sizing, you use a single base; updates to the base then update the rest of the page.

For our example we'll use `em`. `em` indicates the size of the font at the root element - `body` in our example. `em` is a 1 based value, where `1em` is the size of the root element, `1.5em` is one and a half times the size, and `.25em` is one quarter the size. 

Let's set the size for our different header elements. We are using both `h1` and `h2` tags in our resume.

1. At the bottom of **style.css**, add the following...

    ```css
    h1 {
        font-size: 3em;
        letter-spacing: .6em;
        padding-top: 1em;
        padding-bottom: 1em;
    }

    h2 {
        font-size: 1.5em;
        padding-bottom: 1em;
    }
    ```

1. The page updates with the new sizes.

Notice that we can not only set the text size, but we can change the spacing in between letters with the `letter-spacing` property. We can add padding to an element with the `padding` property. All of these properties support the `em` relative sizing.

## Creating a grid

CSS grids are a relatively new feature. Like the name implies, a grid allows you to place elements on a page much in the same way you might lay things out in a table. You can use grids to create columns and rows for your data.

> **Note:** For accessibility purposes, you should avoid using a table to layout a page unless you are displaying tabular data.

Let's review the structure of your page:

    ```html
    <main>
        <article>
            Contact info
        </article>
        <article>
            About you & experience
        </article>
    </main>
    ```

We want to create two columns, one for the first `article` with your contact info, skills, and education, and the second `article` with your work experience. Notice how both `article` elements are contained inside of a single `main` element. We will use the `main` element as the container for our grid. We will configure `main` to host the grid, and configure two column templates - one for each article.

    ```css
        main { 
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: 40% 60%;
            margin-top: 3em;
        }
    ```

This will split the `main` element into two columns. The first top-level element under `main` which is an `article` will be the first column and will take up 40% of the available space. The second top-level element under `main` (also an `article`) will take up the remaining 60%.

## Controlling spacing with the box model

CSS uses what's known as the box model. The box model controls how information is displayed inside an element, and how close to one another elements are placed. There are 3 key properties - `margin`, `border`, and `padding`. The diagram below indicates how these control content placement.

![The box model with Hello world text in the middle, padding indicated between the text and border, and margin indicated between the border and the outside](./media/box-model.png)

In this diagram the content is the text **Hello, world**. `padding` is the space between the text and the black `border`. And `margin` is the space between the `border` and the next element.

Add the remaining style rules to add some padding around the elements on your page:

    ```css
    header {
        text-align: center;
        margin: auto 2em;
    }

    section {
        margin: auto 1em 4em 2em;
    }

    i {
        margin-right: .5em;
    }

    p {
        margin: .2em auto
    }

    hr {
        border: none;
        background-color: lightgray;
        height: 1px;
    }

    h1, h2 {
        font-weight: 100;
        margin-bottom: 0;
    }
    ```
    
* We're centering the text in the `header` element and adding a 2em margin to the left and the right so that the lines from the `hr` don't go all the way to the edge, but have a little padding.
* The `section` element is given some margin so that each section (ABOUT, CONTACT, SKILLS) has spacing around it. The `p` element is also given some margin. 
* The `i` element is given some spacing on the right. These are the icons that we will be adding next. 
* The `hr` element is turned into a thinner gray line by removing its border and providing a background color and height.
* We reduce the `font-weight` or "thickness" of the font of our `h1` and `h2` so that it's not so blocky. 

> **Note:** Notice how we were able to modify multiple elements by listing them with commas: `h1, h2`. Also, `margin-top` and `margin-bottom` sets the margin for the top and bottom respectively. You could also use `margin-left` and `margin-right` to set those values, or provide them all by just using `margin`.

## Selecting an element by ID

Sometimes, you want to style a specific element on a page. For instance, we want to add a thin gray line between our two columns. We can do that by adding a right border to the left column, but both columns are `article` elements. How do we correctly pick the left one?

Notice that each of the `article` elements has an id property - "mainLeft" and "mainRight". We can select these elements by their ID in the CSS and style them. So, to add a border to just the left column, add this final rule to your stylesheet:

    ```css
    #mainLeft {
        border-right: 1px solid lightgray;
    }
    ```

Your resume should look much better now. However, you're still missing some icons in the CONTACT section. For that, we'll need to add an icon font.

## Add an icon font

An icon font is a font that contains symbols and glyphs instead of letters and numbers. In other words, it's a font that contains icons! There are many open source/free icon fonts you can use, and one of the most popuplar is called "Font Awesome". That's the one we'll add to our page.

1. In the **index.html** file, add the following line to the `head` element...

    ```html
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.4/css/all.min.css">
    ```

1. This will load the Font Awesome icon font. You should now see some nifty icons next to your CONTACT data.
