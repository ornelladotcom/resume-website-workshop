# Create an HTML page

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and is used to "markup" the text to be displayed on a webpage. More specifically, HTML is used to describe the importance of the text in a page. With HTML you can indicate a header, create a link to another page, or indicate where an image should be placed.

HTML consists of what are called "tags" or "elements". While there is a technical difference between the two, you will find many developers use the terms interchangeably and generally doesn't impact how we create our code. These tags are read by a browser, and used to determine how to display and interpret the information in a page.

We will begin creating our resume by creating an HTML file and adding the code. You may notice the page won't appear to be very structured or robust; we will make it look better when we add our CSS.

## Create an HTML file with CodeSwing

We will use CodeSwing to create and edit our HTML and CSS in Visual Studio Code. CodeSwing has a variety of templates you can use, and includes support for advanced pages as well. Let's start by creating our first "swing" and using the core HTML template.

1. Open the **Command Palette** by selecting the three parallel lines icon in the left-hand side Activity Bar, then navigating to **View > Command Palette**. You can also quickly open the Command Palette by using the keyboard shortcut **Control+Shift+P** on a PC, or **Command+Shift+P** on a Mac.
4. Type **CodeSwing**, select **CodeSwing: Initialize Workspace as Swing..**.
5. Choose the option for **Basic: HTML-Only** and your new swing will appear, with your HTML file on the left, and a browser window on the right.
1. This will create an **index.html** file in your root directory.

> **IMPORTANT** If you accidentally close the wrong windows, you can re-open CodeSwing by navigating to your repository in github.dev, opening the Command Palette with **Control+Shift+P** (or **Command+Shift+P** on a Mac), typing **CodeSwing**, selecting **CodeSwing: Open Swing...**, and selecting the directory with your files.

You now have the HTML file created for your resume site!

## Create the HTML structure

Let's start adding the HTML for our page. Every HTML page includes three main tags - `html` which contains all the HTML, `head` which includes information about the page, and `body` which contains the contents to display on the page. Tags can also contain **attributes**, which allow us to change how a tag behaves. Attributes are key/value pairs such as `rel="stylesheet"`.

> **Note:** You may notice some of the names are a little cryptic or not necessarily intuitive. This is partly due to the history of HTML. HTML was originally used by scientists and academics as a way to structure documents. As a result, the names or abbreviations used might not always be as clear as we might like.

Most tags have an open (`<tag>`) and a close (`</tag>`), and contain information. So `<title>Demo title</title>` indicates the title of the page. Others will only have a single tag, such as `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`. These types of tags behave much like a command, telling the browser to perform a particular task.

> **Tip:** Don't try to memorize every tag available. Just as memorizing a dictionary isn't a good way to learn a spoken language, memorizing a set of keywords isn't going to aid you in your growth as a developer. As you continue to create pages you'll learn more tags and how they behave.

We're going to use these three tags (and a couple of others) to begin the creation of our resume. We'll explain the tags we're using after we create the page.

1. Inside the **index.html** window, add the following code to create the initial structure of your page, replacing **Your Name** in the `<title>` tag with your name:

    ```html
	<html>
		<head>
			<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">
			<title>Your Name resume</title>
		</head>

		<body>
			<header id="header">
				<!-- resume header with your name and title -->
				<h1><b>YOUR</b> NAME</h1>
				<hr>
				YOUR TITLE (EX: SOFTWARE ENGINEERING STUDENT)
				<hr>
			</header>
			<main>
				<article id="mainLeft">
					<section>
						<h2>CONTACT</h2>
						<!-- contact info including social media -->
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>SKILLS</h2>
						<!-- your skills AKA "buzzwords" -->
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>EDUCATION</h2>
						<!-- your education -->
					</section>            
				</article>
				<article id="mainRight">
					<section>
						<h2>ABOUT</h2>
						<!-- about you -->
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
						<!-- your work experience -->
					</section>
				</article>
			</main>
		</body>
	</html>
    ```

1. Notice how as you type (or copy and paste) the browser window on the right automatically updates with the information you've added.

### Exploring the code

We used several tags to display our page. Below is a table talking about each tag and what they mean. As you look at the code, notice the HTML is in all lower case letters, and the use of tabs to create an outline for the code. While this isn't required, it does make your HTML much more readable.

| tag                          | description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `html`                       | Container for all HTML in an HTML page.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `head`                       | Contains metadata, or information about the page.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `link`                       | Used to tell the page what CSS stylesheet to use. `rel="stylesheet"` indicates we are using a stylesheet, and `href="style.css"` loads **style.css** (which is the name of the stylesheet we'll create in the CSS section of the workshop). |
| `title`                      | Indicates the title of the page to display on the toolbar. This is **not** displayed on the page itself. Every page you create should have a title.                                                              |
| `body`                       | The contents of the page to be displayed to the user.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `header`, `main`, `article`, `section` | These are "semantic" tags. See the description below for more information.                                                                                                                                              |
| `h1`                         | A level 1 header. Header tags go from `h1` to `h6`, with `h1` being the highest level, to `h6` being the lowest level. These are used to create structure for the outline of the page. |
| `p` | A paragraph tag. Paragraph tags are where the body text of your page goes.
| `b` | Makes text appear bold.
| `hr` | Creates a horizontal line. The tag stands for "horizontal rule".
| `id` | `id` is an attribute that allows you to assign a unique id for an HTML element. This will come in handy when we style the HTML. 
| `<!-- comment -->` | These are HTML comments. They are useful for making notes or setting reminders to yourself.

> **Note:** Comments are a great way to take notes as you're learning HTML. You can put a comment right above a section of code, and describe what the section does. But do remember comments **are not** secure, so don't store sensitive information in comments.

#### Semantic tags

Semantic tags are a relatively new addition to HTML. You may notice on the page there is a difference in size between `h1` and `h2`. This is because besides just indicating a level, header tags also modify how content is displayed. Semantic tags such as `header`, `main`, `article` and `section` are only used to group information together. The main advantage is the ability to structure a large HTML document, and later use CSS to control how the content will actually get displayed.

You can use semantic tags however you wish, but a common hierarchy is:

- `header`
- `main`
    - `article`
        - `section`

## Summary and next steps

You've now created your first HTML page! Next, let's [add additional content](./2-add-content.md) such as your email address and sections for your experience.
